# Encryption
 
Project Description

This project involves creating a Client-Server application that allows for the transmission of encrypted messages from the Client to the Server using Transposition Cipher for encryption and decryption.

### Client-Side:

- Receives a message from the keyboard input.
- Encrypts the message using the Transposition Cipher.
- Sends the encrypted message to the Server.

### Server-Side:

- Receives the encrypted message from the Client.
- Displays the encrypted message as received.
- Decrypts the message using the Transposition Cipher.
- Displays the decrypted message in the console.

### Features
- Message Encryption: Ensures secure communication by encrypting messages on the client side before sending them to the server.
- Message Decryption: The server decrypts the received messages and displays both

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
      `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git`
   
2.Navigate to the project directory: 
      `cd your-repo-name`
      
3.Run the Server:
   `python Server.py`
   
4.Run the client:
   `python Client.py`
   
5.Enter a message on the client side: The message will be encrypted and sent to the server, where it will be decrypted and displayed.

### Technical Requirements

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Standard Python libraries for networking and I/O operations.
