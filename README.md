# Encryption
 
Project Description

This project involves creating a Client-Server application that allows for the transmission of encrypted messages from the Client to the Server using Transposition Cipher for encryption and decryption.

Client-Side:

- Receives a message from the keyboard input.
- Encrypts the message using the Transposition Cipher.
- Sends the encrypted message to the Server.

Server-Side:

- Receives the encrypted message from the Client.
- Displays the encrypted message as received.
- Decrypts the message using the Transposition Cipher.
- Displays the decrypted message in the console.

Features
- Message Encryption: Ensures secure communication by encrypting messages on the client side before sending them to the server.
- Message Decryption: The server decrypts the received messages and displays both
